abstract = {A model for software product quality is defined, it has been formulated by associating a set of quality-carrying properties with each of the structural forms that are used to define the statements and statement components of a programming language. These quality-carrying properties are in turn linked to the high-level quality attributes of the International Standard for Software Product Evaluation ISO-9126. The model supports building quality into software, definition of language-specific coding standards, systematically classifying quality defects, and the development of automated code auditors for detecting defects in software.< >},
